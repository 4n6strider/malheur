 Malheur is a software suite for automatic analysis of malware. The 
 suite provides functionality for description, classification and 
 clustering of malware behavior recorded using sandbox techniques.

 The components of Malheur have been designed with effectivity and
 efficiency in mind using modern learning and analysis techniques, 
 such as sparse feature vectors and linear models (liblinear). As 
 input format Malheur supports generic text and XML reports of
 monitored behavior.


 Software dependencies
 --
     >= libconfig-1.3.2
     >= libarchive-2.70
     zlib

 Compilation & Installation
 --
      $ ./configure [options]
      $ make
      $ make check
      $ make install

 Configuration options
 --
     --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation

        By default Malheur is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer 
        a different location, use this option to select a different
        installation directory.

     --enable-openmp         Enable support for OpenMP (experimental)
    
        This option enables support for OpenMP in Malheur. Several 
        functions of the malware analysis have been augmented with 
        OpenMP directives, such that they can be executed in parallel
        and benefit from multi-core architectures.

     --enable-matlab         Enable optional Matlab tools
     --with-matlab-dir=PATH  Set directory prefix of matlab installation

        Some functions of Malheur are available in Matlab .mex files
        which allows for using the implemented analysis methods directly
        from within Matlab.
