 Introduction 
 --

 Malheur is a tool for analysis of malware behavior recorded in a sandbox
 environment. In particular, Malheur provides functionality for automatic
 analysis, classification and clustering of textual reports containing
 recorded behavior. In the clustering task a set of reports is analysed
 for determining groups of similar behavior (clusters) likely originating
 from the same malware family. Clusters with too few members are
 rejected. In the classification task reports of unknown behavior are
 automatically assigned to known clusters. Reports strongly deviating
 from known clusters are also rejected.

 Malheur has been written with effectivity and efficiency in mind. The
 classification and clustering routines both provide state-of-the-art
 performance in terms of accuracy, while the respective functions make
 use of multi-processing and thus run signficantly faster on multi-core
 architectures.

 Dependencies
 --
      >= libconfig-1.3.2
      >= libarchive-2.70

 Compilation & Installation
 --
      $ ./configure [options]
      $ make
      $ make check
      $ make install

      --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation

      By default Malheur is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer
      a different location, use this option to select an installation
      directory.

      --enable-openmp         Enable support for OpenMP (experimental)
    
      This option enables support for OpenMP in Malheur. Several
      functions of the malware analysis have been enhanced using
      OpenMP directives, such that they execute in parallel and
      benefit from multi-core architectures.

      --enable-matlab         Enable optional Matlab tools
      --with-matlab-dir=PATH  Set directory prefix of matlab installation

      Some functions of Malheur are also available in form of Matlab
      .mex files which allows for using implemented analysis
      methods directly from within a Matlab environment.
