 MALHEUR - Automatic Malware Analysis on Steroids

 Introduction 
 --

 Malheur is a software suite for automatic analysis of malware. The
 suite provides functionality for description, classification and
 clustering of malware behavior recorded using sandbox techniques.

 The components of Malheur have been designed with effectivity and
 efficiency in mind using modern learning and analysis techniques, 
 such as sparse feature vectors and linear models (liblinear). As 
 input format Malheur supports generic text and XML reports of
 monitored behavior.

 *Warning* Malheur is currently in a pre-alpha stage. Check back
 later. Most of the code is either not documented or not functional. 
 If you are interested in working with a preliminary version of
 Malheur, please drop an email to <rieck@cs.tu-berlin.de>.


 Dependencies
 --
      >= libconfig-1.3.2
      >= libarchive-2.70
      zlib

 Compilation & Installation
 --
      $ ./configure [options]
      $ make
      $ make check
      $ make install

      --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation

      By default Malheur is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer
      a different location, use this option to select an installation
      directory.

      --enable-openmp         Enable support for OpenMP (experimental)
    
      This option enables support for OpenMP in Malheur. Several
      functions of the malware analysis have been enhanced using
      OpenMP directives, such that they execute in parallel and
      benefit from multi-core architectures.

      --enable-matlab         Enable optional Matlab tools
      --with-matlab-dir=PATH  Set directory prefix of matlab installation

      Some functions of Malheur are also available in form of Matlab
      .mex files which allows for using implemented analysis
      methods directly from within a Matlab environment.
