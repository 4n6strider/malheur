 Malheur is a software suite for automatic analysis of malware. The 
 suite provides functionality for description, classification and 
 clustering of malware behavior recorded using sandbox techniques.

 The components of Malheur have been designed with effectivity and
 efficiency in mind using modern learning and analysis techniques, 
 such as sparse feature vectors and linear models (liblinear). As 
 input format Malheur supports generic text and XML reports of
 monitored behavior.
